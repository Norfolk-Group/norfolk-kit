# Equip a repository with the core-stack

You are adding the Norfolk core-stack (`Norfolk-Group/norfolk-kit`) to the current repository and delivering it as a pull request for Ricardo to approve. He is not a programmer: he will read your summary and click Merge. **Everything that protects him must be mechanical, not narrative** — you write both the change and the summary, so your summary cannot be the safeguard. `kit-guard` is.

**Never:** push to `main`, merge your own PR, delete files, or reword a conflict as a success.

---

## 1. Pre-flight — stop early rather than half-equip

Run these checks and **abort with a plain-English explanation if any fails**. Do not attempt a partial equip.

1. **Repo identity.** `git remote get-url origin` → parse `<org>/<repo>`.
   - No remote, or more than one remote → treat org as **unknown** (see §2) and say so.
2. **Auth + identity match.** `gh auth status`. Confirm the authenticated account can write to this repo. Check `git config user.email`; if it does not match the identity expected for this org, set it per-repo and note it in the PR body. *(SpecFlow C7 — avoids Norfolk-identity commits landing in client repos.)*
3. **Kit readable.** Confirm you can read `Norfolk-Group/norfolk-kit`. If you cannot (common in a Codespace, whose auto-token is scoped to its own repo):
   > Tell Ricardo, in plain words, that this environment can't see the kit yet, and that the fix is a one-time setup: a read-only access token for the kit installed as an org Codespaces secret. Offer the temporary workaround (`unset GITHUB_TOKEN` then `gh auth login`) and note it must be redone on each new Codespace until the secret is in place. **Do not proceed on a partial read.**
4. **Pin the kit.** Resolve `norfolk-kit` to a single commit SHA now and read **everything** at that SHA. Never mix reads across commits. *(C4/I4.)*
5. **Concurrency.** If an open `equip/*` or `tidy/*` PR already exists on this repo, stop and point at it. Two structural PRs at once fight. *(I7.)*
6. **Empty repo.** Zero commits → there is no base branch. Ask Ricardo to confirm, then create the initial commit directly on `main`, then continue normally. *(M1.)*

## 2. Decide the payload — by the repo's org, never by who has access

Read `.kit/payloads.json` from the kit. Look up the org from §1.

- Found → use its `class` and `allowedSensitivities`.
- **Not found** (fork, no remote, multiple remotes, new org) → use `default`: **tooling only, zero brand**, and say plainly in the PR body which org was detected and why the payload was restricted. *(C1/C2.)*

Read `.kit/markers.json`. Every kit file has a sensitivity; **unmatched paths count as `norfolk-only`** (fail closed). Build the payload as: every kit file whose sensitivity ∈ `allowedSensitivities`, **minus** anything matching `$excludeFromPayload`.

Two markers need care:

- **`kit-only`** — never ships anywhere, no exceptions. The kit's own plans, decision records, and Owner's Guide. No org allows it, so the filter already handles it; the point is that copying them would fork the kit, which is the failure the Manual app exists to prevent. The Manual *reads* them from the kit at render time.
- **`$excludeFromPayload`** — files with a valid sensitivity that are still not worth shipping (today: the 180MB brand tree, pending curated web sets). Not a security control — the guard still enforces the marker — just a payload decision. Say in the PR body when something was withheld for this reason.

> Ricardo's rule, and the reason this exists: Norfolk-internal material never enters a client repo, and no client ever sees another client's brand. He controls all three orgs, so nothing but this mapping prevents it.

## 3. Inventory the target and build the plan

For each file in the filtered payload, classify:

| Case | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **ADD** | Not present in the repo | Copy from kit |
| **UPDATE** | Present, listed in the repo's existing `.kit/manifest.json`, and its hash still matches what the manifest recorded | Overwrite with the kit version — it is kit-managed and unmodified |
| **CONFLICT** | Present, kit-managed, but hash differs (locally edited) | **Do not overwrite.** Apply the merge strategy below; list it prominently in the PR |
| **FOREIGN** | Present but never kit-managed | **Never touch.** Note it if it collides in spirit (e.g. their own `AGENTS.md`) |

This is what makes re-equipping meaningful: after a kit update, run equip again and unmodified files move forward while your edits are surfaced rather than steamrolled. *(I1.)*

**Merge strategies for conflicts** *(I2)*:
- **JSON config** (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`): deep-merge additively. Existing keys win; kit keys that are *required* by org policy (e.g. the `neon` MCP block) are injected regardless. Report exactly what you injected.
- **Prose / Markdown** (`AGENTS.md`, docs): never overwrite. Write the kit version alongside as `<name>.kit.md` and summarise the difference in the PR body in one or two sentences a non-programmer can act on.
- **Binary / brand**: never overwrite. Flag only.

## 4. Write the manifest — with the script, never by hand

Copy `.kit/payloads.json`, `.kit/markers.json`, `tools/kit-guard/` and `.github/workflows/kit-guard.yml` into the repo first (all `client-safe`), then run:

```bash
node tools/kit-guard/write-manifest.mjs --kit-sha <pinned SHA> --org <detected org> --discover
```

**Do not hand-write `.kit/manifest.json`.** It is the claim `kit-guard` checks the diff against — if you author both the claim and the change, the guard is comparing your word to your word and checks nothing. The script hashes the real bytes on disk, so a file you wrote but did not intend to claim still surfaces as an unclaimed write.

The script exits non-zero and names the files if anything on disk violates the org's boundary. If that happens: **remove those files and re-run.** Never work around it — it is telling you the payload filter in §2 was applied wrongly.

## 5. Deliver as a pull request

1. Branch: **`equip/<short-kit-sha>`** — deterministic. If it already exists, **update it, don't recreate**; if a PR is already open for it, update that PR. Report leftover state plainly. *(I3.)*
2. Commit with a message that says what changed and why, in the kit's commit style.
3. Push and open the PR. **Never** commit to `main`.
4. **PR body** — this exact structure:
   - **What this does** — three sentences maximum, plain English, no jargon.
   - **Machine-generated file table** — derived from the actual diff, not from your intentions: path · action (ADD/UPDATE/CONFLICT) · sensitivity. *(C5 — a manifest Ricardo can compare against what CI verified.)*
   - **⚠️ Needs your decision** — every CONFLICT, each with a one-line "what I'd do" recommendation. If none: say "None."
   - **Payload note** — the org detected, the payload class applied, and, if `unknown`/restricted, exactly why.
   - **What I did NOT touch** — foreign files that looked related. Reassurance is part of the job.
5. Tell Ricardo the PR is ready, in one short paragraph, and state whether `kit-guard` passed. **Do not merge for him** if the PR contains any CONFLICT — those need a human decision. For a clean all-ADD PR you may offer to merge, and merge only on his explicit yes.

## 6. Dry-run mode

With `--dry-run`, do everything except write, branch, or push: report the plan as the same table. Use this when Ricardo asks "what would equipping do here?"

## Failure conduct

If you fail partway: **say so plainly, say exactly what state the repo is in, and say what you would do next.** A half-equipped repo that is honestly reported is recoverable. A half-equipped repo reported as success is the thing this whole system exists to prevent.
