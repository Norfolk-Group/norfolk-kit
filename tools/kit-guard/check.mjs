/**
 * kit-guard — the control that does not depend on anyone reading a diff.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: the equip and tidy skills write changes AND write the
 * plain-English summary the owner approves on. That is circular trust: a wrong
 * or flattering summary is undetectable by the one person in the loop. This
 * check is the machine half — it refuses to let a PR merge if it violates the
 * boundaries, whatever the summary says.
 *
 * Five rules, all fail-closed:
 *   1. BRAND BOUNDARY  — every kit-managed file present in the repo must carry
 *      a sensitivity this org is allowed to hold. Catches both a bad payload
 *      and a standing violation (e.g. a repo transferred between orgs).
 *   2. MANIFEST SCOPE  — a kit/tidy PR may not add or modify kit-managed paths
 *      that the manifest does not claim. Stops silent scope creep.
 *   3. NO DELETIONS    — equip/tidy PRs carry zero deletions. Real removals go
 *      on a `deletions/`-prefixed branch, where they are allowed, so approval
 *      is unambiguous.
 *   4. MARKER COVERAGE — an unmatched path is treated as kit-only, which no org
 *      may hold, so forgetting to mark a new file means it ships nowhere
 *      instead of leaking somewhere.
 *   5. FILE SIZE       — nothing over 5MB. Large assets go in R2 and the repo
 *      stores the URL. Git keeps every version of a binary forever in every
 *      clone, and removing it later reclaims nothing.
 *
 * Usage (CI):  node tools/kit-guard/check.mjs --base origin/main --head HEAD
 * Usage (dry): node tools/kit-guard/check.mjs --audit-only
